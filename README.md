# Shuttle; A modern config file maker
> Why do I need a program for making config files? You might be someone who likes reading through people's dotfiles, and if you're like me, you might have a hard time reading through hand written ones, because we make them quite cluttered. Having a program make them for you would be much more efficient and neat. 
# Layout & Planning
Shuttle will operate in the following order:
    1. Shuttle will read through a user made config file and detect different specified programs
    2. Shuttle will locate all the specific configurations for said programs
    3. Shuttle will build the unique config files and read over them again to ensure they are as bloat-free as possible
    4. Shuttle will return the locations of the unique config files + any extra information
