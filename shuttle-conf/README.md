# Shuttle; A modern config file maker
> Why do I need a program for making config files? You might be someone who likes reading through people's dotfiles, and if you're like me, you might have a hard time reading through hand written ones, because we make them quite cluttered. Having a program make them for you would be much more efficient and neat. 
# Layout & Planning
### Shuttle will operate in the following order:<br>
    **1. Shuttle will read through a user made config file and detect different specified programs<br>**
    **2. Shuttle will locate all the specific configurations for said programs<br>**
    **3. Shuttle will build the unique config files and read over them again to ensure they are as bloat-free as possible<br>**
    **4. Shuttle will return the locations of the unique config files + any extra information<br>**

TODO: 
    1.  patch config file in a directory
